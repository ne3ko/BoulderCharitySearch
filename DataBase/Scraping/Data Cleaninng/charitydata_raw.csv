From those humble beginnings, the CBA grew to eventually become the recognized voice for bow hunting in Colorado.

As CBA memberships grew in number, new and greater opportunities were envisioned and pursued. Success was not always a given however. Organizations opposed to hunting were equally motivated to advance their political agendas. As a consequence, CBA efforts to expand opportunities for bow hunters were often redirected toward the protection of existing privileges. It eventually became necessary to engage the professional assistance of a lobbyist in order to detect and mitigate potential threats. This political watch guard continues today and remains a costly but necessary expense.

Throughout its existence, the CBA has nurtured and refined its relationship with the DOW and CWC. The success of this on going endeavor has resulted in several key events. Most notable include invitations from the DOW to provide input to the 5-Year big game archery season structures, requests from the CWC to present an archery education seminar to its commissioners, and solicitations from the commissioners to speak at CBA Area Rep meetings.

Craniosacral and Polarity Therapies both originated with American osteopathic physicians in the mid-twentieth century, and were subsequently adopted outside the medical profession. Both propose that human health derives from subtle forces that can be palpated. Both use manual methods to optimize the expression of the body’s inner healing resources and intelligence.

Biodynamic Craniosacral Therapy and Polarity Therapy look beyond mechanistic interpretations of symptoms to address subtle factors in health conditions. Unlike methods that fix problems from the outside, these energy-based approaches support healing from within and empower clients to take more responsibility for their health conditions. Additionally, these methods explore how mind and body are interdependent, not separate: physical problems often have a mental component, and mental/emotional states often have physical aspects.","The Colorado School of Energy Studies offers professional training in Biodynamic Craniosacral Therapy, Polarity Therapy and related healthcare topics.

Meanwhile, the northern hemisphere has already lost a million square miles of spring snowpack since 1970—an area three times the size of Texas.  Snow levels are rising in elevation and winters are shorter. Climate change is already  affecting winter.

By 2007, pro snowboarder Jeremy Jones found that more and more resorts he’d always counted on for good riding were closed due to lack of snow. Something was clearly going on, and he felt the need to act. But he couldn’t find any organizations focused on mobilizing the snowsports community on climate—there was a gap between the impacts that climate change was already having on our mountains, and any organized action being taken to address it. And so Jeremy founded Protect Our Winters.

Soon afterwards, we brought on other concerned pro athletes, individuals, resorts and winter sports companies. Since then, Protect Our Winters has grown from a kernel of an idea into a worldwide network of over 130,000 supporters – a social movement on climate, designed to activate a passionate community and create the political will for meaningful action by state and federal policymakers.","Protect Our Winters (POW) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit.

Our mission is to bring people together from all parts of the world, in the understanding that we are essentially motivated by the same vision-quest to love and be loved in a harmonious world. OSI’s educational, cultural and exchange programs are designed to bring about transformative personal change, such that the participants will become enpowered to move into adulthood as peacemakers and change agents, actively working to secure a positive future for us all.","The first and second OSI Logos were conceived from a 1982 dream. OSI Founder, Billie Hopkins, saw a heralding angel, trumpet in hand, flying over the Colorado Rockies at sunrise. She quickly sketched out what appeared as a seal or a crest that might be found on a gold coin. At first, she thought she was supposed to start a publishing company, but later realized that the One Society Angel from her dream had a much greater task to accomplish. In 1987 she became the Youth Support Director for Youth Ambassadors of America, organizing and conducting eleven bi-lateral youth summit meetings and summer camps in Russia and Maui, Hawaii. Then, in May of 1989, she returned from her final exchange. As politics would have it, YAA had lost their support structure in Russia, which was based on partners closely tied to Gorbachev and the Soviet Peace Committee. The entire Youth Ambassadors Bridge crumbled, right along with the Berlin Wall. Billie went into immediate action to design a New Bridge – a stronger bridge as a truly intercultural, intergenerational structure that would support, nurture, celebrate and steadfastly promote our Human Oneness as Peacemakers; withstand the mercurial whims of governments; destructive torrents of time; flimsy perceptions of personality. This new, strong bridge became One Society International, and she has always envisioned OSI as The New Bridge – a structure to support an ongoing network of cross-cultural, cross-generational programs nurturing and celebrating differences and similarities within One Human Family living in harmony.",http://onesocietyinternational.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/EarthAngel_275_275.jpg,1995,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

Our guest for Colorado Regional Meeting will be Quaker historian and theologian Paul Buckley. The theme for the weekend, which grows out of Paul’s research, is “Reviving Quakerism: Building Communities of Love, Hope, and Joy.” Age-appropriate children’s programs are provided. When you come into the meetinghouse before worship you may find some Friends already sitting in silence. There is generally a “centering” that occurs at the beginning of Meetings when Friends seek to clear their minds of distractions and come to a receptive state. We listen and wait for a direct experience of the Divine. Some may be moved to share their experience by standing and speaking. About 15 minutes before the end of worship, the children enter the room to join us in worship. The meeting ends when friends shake hands and greet each other. Following worship, Friends share joys and sorrows, welcome new people, share announcements and enjoy a time of fellowship.","Mountain View Friends Meeting is a Meeting of the Religious Society of Friends (often known as ""Quakers"").

Shoes for Africa was started after sports journalist Mike Sandrock returned from a coaching and racing trip to Cameroon, West Africa, sponsored by the U.S. Information Agency. Many of the runners from Cameroon ran barefoot (and were still able to beat Sandrock), and afterwards, a group of Boulder elite runners including Lorraine Moller, Steve Jones and Arturo Barrios began shipping shoes to West Africa. Since then a group of runners in Boulder has collected, washed, and sent shoes, T-shirts, and shorts to needy athletes and children around the world. The project continues to grow with shoes and athletic equipment being sent in from around the United States. Now called “One World Running” the group is a 100-percent volunteer organization, and the program has now expanded globally. The West End 3K criterium road race in downtown Boulder was started in August, 2001, as fundraiser for Shoes for Africa. In a recent addition, soccer cleats are now collected, as well as baseball equipment.

Shoes are dropped off at local running stores, and a Boulder laundry, Community Plaza, donates the washing – but you can always wash the shoes before shipping them to us, in cold water and air dried (as the dryer can melt the glue, as we found out!) Shipping has been tight recently, as the airlines have cut back on their donations.

As reported by the Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring (ADDM) Network in March 2012, as many as 1 out of 88 children born today has an autism spectrum disorder or ASD. And a report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has estimated that rate is as high as 1 in 50. Other disabilities are also becoming more prevalent, according to the CDC.

Further complicating the situation, parents with special needs children are often unaware of possible tax benefits that are available and forgo hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars in potential tax deductions and credits. Michael A. O’Connor, an attorney who has written extensively on this topic, believes that 15% to 30% of families with a disabled child have one or more unclaimed tax benefits. Among these potential tax benefits are deductions or credits for the dependency exemption, medical expenses, special instruction, capital expenditures for medically required home improvements, impairment-related work expenditures, and the earned income tax credit.","As the number of children diagnosed with autism, Asperger’s syndrome, and other neurological disorders continues to skyrocket, the disruption it causes in the lives of all those concerned is unmistakable",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

Brainspotting (BSP) uses a Mind/Body approach to psychotherapy that evolved from Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) and the Somatic Experiencing (SE) Traditions. Upsetting memories are stored deep within the brain and the body.  BSP helps to release these stressors because it works from the deeper level of the autonomic nervous system and within the limbic system in the brain. Brainspotting is an effective and efficient healing modality that can be used with children, adolescents and adults and has been beneficial with all types of performance work and spiritual development.","Brainspotting, an emerging new treatment in psychotherapy.
