Although we have been organizing events and growing since 2010, in 2013 we decided to organize as a nonprofit organization at the suggestion of friends at 350.org in order to better support local 350 teams around the state financially and logistically and to more effectively address how Colorado contributes to and can help solve the climate crisis. By June of 2013, Executive Director Micah Parkin had started 350 Colorado with a Board of Directors from teams around the state. In September of 2014, 350 Colorado received 501(c)(3) nonprofit status from the IRS. The mission of 350 Colorado (350CO) is to work locally to help build the global grassroots movement to solve the climate crisis and transition to a sustainable future. 350 Colorado has established itself as the largest Colorado-based grassroots network focused on taking action to stop climate change.	350 Colorado has established itself as the largest Colorado-based grassroots network focused on taking action to stop climate change.	https://scontent-dfw5-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/12107754_1081404105246897_4709138346467097884_n.png?_nc_cat=111&_nc_ht=scontent-dfw5-1.xx&oh=f9e50a78ca3ba811ff4c58068c05dcce&oe=5CA80BB7	2014

Rather than relying on wildlife officers to respond to a crisis of a bear in town,  BBC has focused on educating and empowering the community to keep bears from coming into town (by reducing attractants, increasing deterrents) so that wildlife officers do not need to handle bears in town. For community members who do not reduce the main attractants (unsecured trash) then the city steps in to implement and enforce these laws. A community is built on shared values, and because wildlife is something that most residents in Boulder value, BBC was born from a need to create a cohesive understanding of what we can do, in clear steps, to protect bears and how we can effectively communicate this information to one another.	The Boulder Bear Coalition implements preventative measures to reduce human-bear conflicts to keep local black bears wild and free and the Boulder community safe.	https://scontent-dfw5-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/1779342_203227426552905_1121937662_n.jpg?_nc_cat=106&_nc_ht=scontent-dfw5-1.xx&oh=b014c855f49e3c2346b537e5cdc38f17&oe=5C6F39BF	2015

His teachings, presented in contradiction to the narrowness of classical Vedanta, offer a broad synthesis of all that is finest in Indian spirituality, fusing the Jnana yoga of the Vedantics, the esoteric yoga of Macchendranath’s tantric yogi lineage and the bhakti of the common people. Later, as Moslem influences pervaded the region where Saint Jnaneshwar's spiritual heirs lived, Sufism and the jnana-bhakti yoga of Jnaneshwar fused to form a path that defied all categories of limited religion. The greatest manifestation of this part of complete universality was Sai Baba of Shirdi, one of the main teachers of the Alandi lineage.	The spirituality of Alandi presents a balance of particular and universal, being deeply rooted in a lineage which has, from time out of mind, had a remarkably universalist and ecumenical character.	https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5961338d4c8b034eb8980da3/t/59614c45414fb5783d03e503/1542740329156/?format=1500w	1999

After working for many years as an independent choreographer, Pat Connelly was commissioned in 1995 to hire dancers and create works for a concert at the Denver Art Museum. It was very successful, so this unconventional group of dancers kept on working together under the company name. In 1998, Blue Moon Dance Company received non-profit status.<br><br>Since 1995, works by thirty different choreographers have been presented and more are added each year. The styles range from hip-hop to classic Graham technique; from jumping jive to ballet duets on pointe; from traditional methods to avant-garde compositions. Dance critics have reacted favorably to this eclectic approach and have applauded the company's versatility and exuberance. The composition of the company is unusual: technically varied, the training and professional backgrounds of the dancers range from hip-hop, modern and ballroom dance to classical ballet; ethnically diverse, the dancers are a challenge to lighting designers because of the skin tones and to costume designers because of the assorted body types. Because partnering is a significant element in the repertory, the company strives to maintain gender equity (as many men as women), and equal pay scales for everyone whether they are true dance professionals or students who are just entering the field. The ages of the dancers span four decades of training, but all are committed to producing a high caliber of dance regardless of the level of expertise.

Their goal was simple; try to establish equitable big game seasons just for bow hunters.

From those humble beginnings, the CBA grew to eventually become the recognized voice for bow hunting in Colorado.<br><br>As CBA memberships grew in number, new and greater opportunities were envisioned and pursued. Success was not always a given however. Organizations opposed to hunting were equally motivated to advance their political agendas. As a consequence, CBA efforts to expand opportunities for bow hunters were often redirected toward the protection of existing privileges. It eventually became necessary to engage the professional assistance of a lobbyist in order to detect and mitigate potential threats. This political watch guard continues today and remains a costly but necessary expense.<br><br>Throughout its existence, the CBA has nurtured and refined its relationship with the DOW and CWC. The success of this on going endeavor has resulted in several key events. Most notable include invitations from the DOW to provide input to the 5-Year big game archery season structures, requests from the CWC to present an archery education seminar to its commissioners, and solicitations from the commissioners to speak at CBA Area Rep meetings. These key events are ample evidence of the mutual respect developed between our state agencies and the CBA through years of cooperation and diligent negotiation.

77	Kids Included Of Colorado	2195 Norwood Ave	Boulder	CO	80304	https://www.kidsincluded.org/	802-373-6868	\N	Education	Kids Included of Colorado was founded by two occupational therapists, specializing in neurological disorders, who recognized the importance for all children to learn through physical experiences and the subsequent need to empower movement-based extracurricular programs to serve both neurodiverse and neurotypical children. Teachers report that the overall classroom climate becomes more respectful and productive when students with disabilities are included. KIoC was launched to fill a critical gap in Boulder community’s initiative to grow and nurture inclusivity. Today, we serve as the only organization in the Boulder area who trains and educates existing extracurricular program owners and staff to extend their programs to include neurodiverse children. Since KIoC’s inception we have witnessed neuro-inclusive programming not only improve the lives of neurodiverse children, but also dramatically increase empathy in neurotypical students and boost confidence in teachers. At KloC, we cherish acceptance, encourage bravery, and are passionate about the power of all children learning and playing together.	KIoC started by engaging a community of parents with neurodiverse children; children diagnosed with neurological disorders, chromosomal abnormalities, physical disabilities, learning challenges, and other special needs.	https://www.kidsincluded.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/KIOC-LOGO-FINAL-COLOR-01SCREEN-400x400.jpg	2016

This stereotype of the mentally ill person leads to all kinds of misconceptions—that they are likely to be dangerous and incapable, that their illness is due to "lack of discipline" and that they are more responsible for their condition than are people with any other illness or disorder. Worse still, people with mental illness, themselves, and their family members share these misconceptions.<br><br>There are many consequences of stigma—people diagnosed with mental illness lose their sense of power and self–worth, health curricula in schools ignore serious mental illness and families feel isolated from their neighbors and, often, from the treatment providers.

Lying entirely above 16,000 ft (4,869 m) and surrounded by 20,000 ft (6,100 m) high, glaciated peaks, the Sibinacocha watershed is an extreme environment by any standard, yet it contains stunning natural beauty and a remarkable array of wildlife. Herds of wild vicuña and elusive taruca deer roam the hills. Carnivores including puma, culpeo fox, and endangered Andean cats stalk the mountains. More than 60 species of birds have been documented, setting altitude records for several species, and the watershed is home to the world’s highest documented amphibian populations.<br><br>At its heart, covering 20% of the watershed, is Laguna Sibinacocha. This 11-mile (18-km) long lake is the largest, high-alpine lake in South America. Despite its size, Sibinacocha itself remains virtually unstudied. No field research has been conducted to document its native fish and aquatic invertebrate species, yet they are under threat by introduced trout that grow to enormous size feeding on native faunal species that have evolved with no natural predator. There are also archaeological remnants suggesting that Sibinacocha and its adjacent mountains had spiritual significance to the Incan and pre-Incan cultures, and likely contain important ceremonial sites.	We are a US-based 501(c)(3) not-for-profit organization dedicated to the research and conservation of the Lake Sibinacocha Watershed in southern Perú.	http://www.sibinacocha.org/newsite/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/large-font-nb-small.png	2015

109	Snow Lion School	2580 Iris Ave	Boulder	CO	80304	http://snowlionschool.com/	720-564-0456	info@snowlionschool.org	Education	Snow Lion began in the autumn of 1995 as a small playgroup of three children. Soon, word of our little home based school spread and several months later, we had a full class. After years of leasing, we found a permanent home for our school in 2014. Initially the building and grounds were run-down but with amazing vision and effort by the Snow Lion community, the environment was transformed. We currently have an older class for 2.5-6 year olds and a younger class for 1.5-3 year olds. The younger class is affectionately known as the Snow Cubs. Student teacher ratio in the older class is about 7.5:1 and 4:1 in the younger group.<br><br>Children at our school come 2-5 days per week, Monday through Friday. Parents choose their children's schedules (which days and 1/2 or full day) on an individual basis. We have a mixed-age group program. Mixed age groups resemble families and create a village quality to our classes with each child and developmental group filling a niche that benefits the group as a whole. Children's social skills, knowledge base, and abilities broaden as they interact with others whose knowledge and abilities are similar yet not identical. In a mixed age group, children are able to develop at their own pace and always have peers who are developing at their level, regardless of their age. The children develop a deep sense of community as they move through the passage of being the youngest, observing and benefitting from the confidence and skills of older children, and then developing into being the class elders themselves.	Snow Lion is a contemplative school for young children. Contemplative education is experiential and happens from the inside out rather than being imposed from the outside in. 	http://www.snowlionschool.org/_images/mural.jpg	2004

Traditionally, this was a high-growth region where energy efficiency efforts were lagging compared to some other regions, emphasis was placed on energy production, energy costs were relatively low but rising, and air pollution was a growing concern. Due in large part to the efforts of SWEEP, the region has made great strides in advancing energy efficiency over the past 17 years. <br><br>SWEEP focused initially on utility energy efficiency policy and programs. Programs on buildings, industries, and transportation efficiency were subsequently added. In 2010, SWEEP initiated a new program to provide assistance to states, counties, and cities. SWEEP collaborates with utilities, state and local governments, environmental groups, national laboratories, businesses, and other energy experts. <br><br>SWEEP was founded in 2001 by Howard Geller, who previously served as the Executive Director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy in Washington, DC. Funding for SWEEP is provided primarily by charitable foundations, the U.S. Department of Energy, and business allies.

We are proud that we do not euthanize animals due to lack of kennel space or their length of stay.	https://www.boulderhumane.org/sites/default/files/logo.png	1933

As a result, much of the basic research funded by the public often sounds ridiculous to the majority of those who pay for it. Gradually, this has led to a growing reluctance by the public to fund basic research, and the annual budget of the National Science Foundation has stagnated as a consequence. To combat this trend in our own field, we formed a non-profit organization in July 1999 to serve as a direct link between the public and the leading researchers who study individual stars. Our mission is to approach this problem through public education efforts in our local communities, as well as through our website.

Keeping families together after a tragedy like this is very important to healing, understanding and guidance. The Vogels' family have come into contact with others that are struggling after a similar tragedy. Some have been able to find a way to make it through each day. However, others haven’t been so fortunate. Because of the absence in support, some of these grieving parents have lost everything: Marriage, Job, Home, Vehicles, Dignity, Respect.... and are now homeless, battling alcohol/drug addictions, depression, thoughts of suicide, PTSD....<br><br>It doesn't have to be this way! The loss is more than enough to deal with. Losing everything else because of no support shouldn't have to happen. Teresa and John have had exceptional support since day one and know the difference this makes in the lives of those struggling after a tragedy.

303	One World Running Inc	3500 16Th St 	Boulder	CO	80302	http://oneworldrunning.com/	303-545-6147	oneworldrunning @ gmail.com	Health	Since 1986, a group of runners in Boulder, Colorado, has collected, washed and sent to Third World countries new and “near-new” athletic shoes, T-shirts and shorts, along with medicine and school and art supplies. Shoes for Africa was started after sports journalist Mike Sandrock returned from a coaching and racing trip to Cameroon, West Africa, sponsored by the U.S. Information Agency. Many of the runners from Cameroon ran barefoot (and were still able to beat Sandrock), and afterwards, a group of Boulder elite runners including Lorraine Moller, Steve Jones and Arturo Barrios began shipping shoes to West Africa. Since then a group of runners in Boulder has collected, washed, and sent shoes, T-shirts, and shorts to needy athletes and children around the world. The project continues to grow with shoes and athletic equipment being sent in from around the United States. Now called “One World Running” the group is a 100-percent volunteer organization, and the program has now expanded globally. The West End 3K criterium road race in downtown Boulder was started in August, 2001, as fundraiser for Shoes for Africa. In a recent addition, soccer cleats are now collected, as well as baseball equipment.<br><br>Shoes are dropped off at local running stores, and a Boulder laundry, Community Plaza, donates the washing – but you can always wash the shoes before shipping them to us, in cold water and air dried (as the dryer can melt the glue, as we found out!) Shipping has been tight recently, as the airlines have cut back on their donations. Now called One World Running, we are a Colorado non-profit organization with federal 501-c-3 tax-exempt status.	One World Running is an international program promoting an awareness of health, fitness and nutrition by providing running shoes to those in need in the United States and around the world.
