# BoulderCharitySearch
A website with the purpose of creating a stronger network of nonprofits and volunteers with the purpose of connecting and increasing charitable activity within the city of Boulder. This site was made by six students at the University of Colorado Boulder and is accessible via the url https://bouldercharitysearch.com. There are hundreds of charities listed on the site with brief discriptions of the charity as well as financial information like their IRS tax forms. This will allow users of the sight to understand the mission of a charity and how a donator can expect their money to be used.

This rebository stores the html, php, and database for the website. Each folder is labled. Also on this repository are pictures used on the website and our logo, designed by Nikolai Alexander.
