# BoulderCharitySearch
A website with the purpose of creating a stronger network of nonprofits and volunteers with the purpose of connecting and increasing charitable activity within the city of Boulder. This site was made by six students at the University of Colorado Boulder and is accessible via the url https://bouldercharitysearch.com. There are hundreds of charities listed on the site with brief discriptions of the charity as well as financial information like their IRS tax forms. This will allow users of the sight to understand the mission of a charity and how a donator can expect their money to be used.

On our website, the user can look up information about the six member team and get into contact with them. To view charities the user will select a category of charity and select from a list of charities that belong to that category. Selecing any charity will take the user to a page that displays the charities financial information, description, and logo as well as a link to that charities website if the user want to research more, sign up, or make a donation.

This repository stores the HTML (and CSS), PHP, and database for the website. Each folder is labled. Also on this repository are pictures used on the website and our logo, designed by Nikolai Alexander. The index.php is used to set our homepage.
